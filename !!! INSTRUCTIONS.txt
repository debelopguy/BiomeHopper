INSTRUCTIONS FOR BCWO MACRO

before opening the main BIOME HOPPER 3000 file:
1. SET YOUR RESOLUTION TO 1600x900, OR ELSE IT WONT FIND BIOMES PROPERLY!
2. if your default browser saves tabs upon closing, set it in settings to not do that,
because the macro will keep opening the vip link and may or may not eat your ram
3. open settings.json. and read the following:

* webhook [RECOMMENDED]: set that as your webhook link. if kept as "None" there will be no
webhook notifications.

* vip [REQUIRED]: set that as your roblox vip server link. HAS TO BE FILLED IN OBVIOUSLY!!!

* waitbeforerejoin: set to a number between 20 and 120. lower or higher will
default to 20/120. default is 60 and is recommended you keep it that way

* browsertoclose [REQUIRED]: set that as your default browser exe name. chrome is "chrome",
firefox is "firefox", opera gx is "opera". if you dont see your browser here go to task
manager, find the browser process and its name and insert it in here.

* whichslottoequip: set that to 1-4, that'll be the slot of the weapon your character
will equip and use (m1, z,x,c) after zooming out. its recommended to not use ANY items
that may obstruct the camera's view to locate the biome (e.g sunshine grimoire, tlitw etc)
default is 1.

* keytopause: set that to a key you'd like to press to stop the script manually before
finding a rare biome. default is "p". stick to regular keys, otherwise it might break

* strugglemessage: set that to the message you want to display upon skipping.

* struggleattachment: set that to the link of an image you want to display upon skipping.

after settings.json is fully setup, you're free to open the file :)
