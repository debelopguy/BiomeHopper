# super duper biome hopper 3000 ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž
a macro for balanced craftwars overhaul that automatically rejoins your vip, skips unnecessary biomes and notifies of rare biomes!
# BASIC REQUIREMENTS! (before you download)
* MUST BE ON **WINDOWS** (other OSs are possible but require changing some code around)
* MUST HAVE A **1600X900 RESOLUTION OPTION** (biome/boss detection)
(if you dont have that resolution option, you can take screenshots of the biomes and replace the folder ones with yours, that may or may not work though)
## FYI this is not an exploit and is safe to use! none of the files try to inject into roblox and only imitate button presses like a macro would.
if you are still skeptical and have some coding knowledge, you can look into the source code and check for yourself

# read instructions before running main .exe or .py
and have fun getting ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ biomes
